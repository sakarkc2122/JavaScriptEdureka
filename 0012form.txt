# Form Validations:
- HTML forms can be validated by JS
- The main goal of Data Validation is to ensure correct user input
- Validation can be defined by many different methods, and deployed in many different ways:
1. Server-side validation is performed by a web server, after input has been sent to the server.
2. Client-side validation is performed by a web browser, before input is sent to the web server.
- Saves a lot of unnecessary calls to the server as all processing is handled by the web browser.

# Typical Validation:
1. Check if the input field is empty.
2. Check if the input field is a numeric value.
3. Check if the input field is a valid email id.
