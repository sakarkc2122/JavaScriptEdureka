Syntax:
1. Defination of function:
    function nameOfFunction (parameters/arguments){}
    
2. Calling of a function:
    nameOfFunction();


Types of Functions:
On the basis of how it is defined and called, functions are categorized in 4 types
1. Named Functions: has a unique name
2. Anonymous Functions: does not have any name
3. Self Invoking Functions: function that calls ifself
4. Constructors: is called when an object is created using the new keyword

2. Anonymous Functions:
-Stored in a variable
    var add = function(a,b){return a+b};
    add(2,3);
    },5000);

-Passed as an argument to another function
    setTimeout(function()
    {
        alert("this message is displayed after 5 seconds");
    }, 5000);

    //setTimeout is a global method that is given by JS
    //It takes two arguments: function that is to be executed and timeToSleep in number

3. Constructors:
-new keyword is followed by what type of object you want to create.

4. Self Invoking Functions:
- are anonymous functions, which are invoked right after the function has been defined.
- you can execute the code once, without declaring any global variables.
- No reference is maintained to this function, not even to its reutrn value.
- Syntax:
(function(){
    //body
}() );
